  Method returns the Max Amount robbed by the robber, see below for problem statement:
  Problem statement :
    A robber enters a colony of houses numbered from 1 to n.  Every house has 
    a number printed on the top of it.  That number is the amount of money inside
    that house. However, there is one constraint. 
    If the robber robs i-th house, he can't rob house no i-1 and house no i+1. 
    How can the robber maximise his robbery?
